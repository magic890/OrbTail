## Bug

- **Multiplayer score** user points not synced between clients causing mixed results.
- **Rocket** on low-end Android devices sometimes the rocket hits the shooter ship. This could be due to the low FPS causing lag on detecting the ship position before generate the rocket to shoot.


## Enhancement

- **HUD** player name on the top of the ship. Beat up your friends! ðŸ˜ƒðŸŽ‰
- **Network** improve prediction.
- **General optimization** remove the millions of `Instantiate`.
- **Rocket** Enable wall and orbs collision. Orb collision will not blow up the rocket, instead it will push away orbs, this will add more fun to the environment!
